    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat your grill to 300 degrees</li>
        <li>Split the 1lb. of hamburger meat in to two, mostly equal sized peices.</li>
        <li>Form a round ball of hamburger with each peice and then slowly press it into the shape of a hamburger patty.</li>
        <li>Liberally apply Kinder "Buttery Steakhouse" seasoning to both sides of both patties and push the seasoning in as much as possible.</li>
        <li>Now grill the patties on the preheated grill to your desired finished temperature.</li>
        <li>Add cheese as grilling nears completion so it is melted before building your burger.</li>
        <li>Split apart the halves of the hamburger bun and put them "inside-down" on the grill as it nears completion.</li>
        <li>When finished, take the bottom part of the bun off first and add it to your plate.</li>
        <li>Next, add the first hamburger with cheese and slather Inglehoffer mustard on it.</li>
        <li>Take the second burger and place it on top. Slather G. Hughes BBQ sauge on it.</li>
        <li>Finally add the top of the bun.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
