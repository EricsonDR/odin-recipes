    <h2>Ready to Make Barbacoa Beef Street Tacos — at Home?</h2>
    <p>“I’ve been hankering for a street taco lately, so I started playing around in my kitchen with the next best thing: barbacoa beef taco recipes at home. The best street taco barbacoa has the distinct flavor of cumin. And because it has been slow cooked for hours, the beef also takes on this unbelievably rich, deep, smoky, almost coffee-like flavor. That’s what I was going for: real-deal street taco sabor”</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 lb brisket or flank steak</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp cumin</li>
        <li>2 tsp paprika, sweet or smoked</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 poblano, Anaheim or green bell peppers, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>1 red onion, chopped</li>
        <li>12 cloves garlic, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp coriander, ground</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 to 1 1⁄4 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>10 soft corn or flour tortillas</li>
        <li><strong>Taco Toppings and Garnishes:</strong> 1 cup cabbage, shredded; 1⁄3 cup jalapeños, minced; 1 cup cilantro, chopped; 1 cup pico de gallo; 1⁄2 Mexican crema, drizzled; 1 cup tomatoes, chopped; 1 cup avocado, chopped; 3 limes, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add oil into a large caserola or Dutch oven on medium high heat. Place brisket in the pot and sear the meat—for 6 minutes on each side.</li>
        <li>Into the same pot with the seared beef, add the chopped peppers, onion and garlic. Cook until softened, about 10 minutes, stirring them into the pot and turning the beef a few times.</li>
        <li>In a 4-cup measuring cup or large mixing bowl, measure the tomato sauce and add the cumin, paprika, coriander, oregano, cider vinegar, salt, pepper and chicken broth. Stir well. Pour on top of the brisket and carefully turn the brisket to be sure it marinates in and incorporates all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bring the brisket and its liquid to a boil, uncovered, on medium high heat. Once the brisket has begun to boil, cover and reduce to low heat.</li>
        <li>In about 10 minutes, check to see that the brisket is simmering. If it isn’t, raise the heat to medium low.</li>
        <li>Simmer the brisket, covered, for 4 to 5 hours.</li>
        <li>When the brisket is fork tender and shredding in the pot, remove from the heat and let cool for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once cooled, carefully remove the brisket onto a large cutting board. With two forks, shred the brisket.</li>
        <li>Put the shredded brisket back into the pot with the sauce, turn the heat back on to medium, and simmer the shredded beef for another 30 minutes—with the lid on.</li>
        <li>Lightly warm your tortillas in a 200° oven for about 5 minutes before assembling with your choice of toppings: shredded cabbage, jalapeños, cilantro, tomatos, avocado, crema and/or a squeeze of fresh lime—however you like it!</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> For toppings, mix and match en la combinación you like best. Michelle’s non-negotiables are shredded cabbage, cilantro, tomatoes, a dash of crema, and a fresh squeeze of lime. Perfection.</em></p>
