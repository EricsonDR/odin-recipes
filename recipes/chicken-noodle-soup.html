    <h2>A favorite meal for cold winter days.</h2>
    <p>When I'm feeling under the weather, I only want one thing: cozy and comforting chicken noodle soup. I'm not the only one who feels this way—this classic soup is one of the world’s most beloved comfort foods, and I definitely took that to heart when creating this recipe. Chunks of juicy chicken mingle with carrots, celery, and tender egg noodles in a deep, savory broth for a soup that will transport you right back to Grandma’s table after just one spoonful. Read on for everything you need to know to make this classic recipe:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken: Skin-on, bone-in chicken parts give you the most flavorful broth. Using a mix of dark meat and white meat is ideal; the dark meat parts take well to long simmering, while the white meat parts can be pulled early and shredded, yielding lots of juicy chicken for the final soup.</li>
        <li>Herbs: No need to reinvent the wheel here. I went with bay leaf and thyme, the signature flavors of a classic chicken noodle soup.</li>
        <li>Noodles: Wide egg noodles are my go-to for chicken noodle soup. Why? Well, there’s the convenience factor—they cook directly in the soup, no separate boiling and draining required—but also because they have flavor in their corner. Richer than standard wheat noodles, they make for a heartier, more satisfying soup.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>We’ll begin by browning the chicken to develop a deep flavor that we’ll then capture in our broth.. Heat oil in a large pot, preferably a Dutch oven, over medium-high heat. Season the chicken pieces on both sides with 2 tsp. salt, and then place in the pot skin side down. Cook, undisturbed, until golden brown underneath (the more you move the chicken, the less it will brown—so don’t do it!). Turn the chicken over with tongs and cook until golden brown on the second side. About 5 minutes per side should be sufficient.</li>
        <li>Now let’s get our broth going. The idea here is to give individualized attention to the white meat and dark meat parts so as to play to their strengths. Pour in the stock and water, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon (we want that flavor in our broth!). Add the thyme sprigs and bay leaf. Bring the liquid to a gentle simmer—bubbles should break the surface only intermittently—and cook, adjusting the heat as needed to maintain a simmer, until the chicken breasts are cooked through; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the flesh should register 165°. Gentle heat is the key to extracting maximum flavor while ensuring moist, juicy meat. Transfer the breasts to a cutting board and let them cool. Continue to simmer the dark meat pieces for another 40 minutes, then transfer to the cutting board and let cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Time to shred. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin and bones from both white and dark meat parts. Using 2 forks, shred the meat into bite-sized pieces. Set the chicken aside for a moment while we work on our aromatic vegetables and noodles.</li>
        <li>Remove and discard the bay leaf and thyme sprigs from the broth. Add the onion, celery, and carrot (our aromatics) to the pot and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are just tender, about 5 minutes. Now for the noodles: Add them directly to the broth. (This is the beauty of egg noodles—they cook directly in the soup, absorbing its flavors and throwing off enough starch to lend a bit of body.) Simmer the egg noodles, stirring occasionally, until tender, about another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now let's bring our shredded chicken back into play. Return the chicken to the pot and add the black pepper; taste and add more salt if needed.</li>
        <li>To serve, divide the soup among bowls and top with chopped parsley and more black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
